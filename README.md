# HEEDvsLeach
Comparison of HEED and LEACH clustering protocols using Arduino sensor nodes and Wi-Fi UDP communication.
This project demonstrates the implementation and analysis of two popular clustering protocols: HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed Clustering) and LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy). The goal is to compare how different cluster-head selection strategies affect energy consumption distribution within a wireless sensor network.

The simulation is built using Arduino devices acting as sensor nodes, communicating wirelessly via Wi-Fi UDP. Practical tests include measuring energy use and analyzing data transmission efficiency.

Technologies: C++, Python, Arduino IDE, WiFiUDP, distributed systems prototyping.
